# BLIP
We are going to work on the [BLIP]() trainer + playback code. This folder discusses the BLIP trainer that will also interface with other models to prepare the dataset for the training.

## Dataset
For now we are starting with solely [Breakheart Pass](Breakheart-Pass(1975){tmdb-8043}.mp4) (1975) + a let's play full run-through of the first main train robbery scene from Red Dead Redemption 2. We will begin by learning how well the [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/blip) detects the images.

## Training


## Anotation
We will be using [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to run [Gemma 3:27b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-27b-pt) locally on our computer.
