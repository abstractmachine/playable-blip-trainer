Here are our answers:

	1.	Vocabulary policy

	•	Open vs. closed lists
	- Open, but all words should be coherent with the historical context of westerns, cowpokes, and frontier landscapes and culture	

	2.	Token form & normalization

	•	Casing: lowercase only?
Yes, lowercase only

	•	Word boundaries: allow multiword tokens like "fur coat"
Yes, multi-words, separated by commas, as short as possible. For example: "fur coat, gun, journal, confederate hat"

	•	Singular/plural normalization (e.g., "horse" vs "horses")?
Both:
- single when a single person or item
- plural when there are more than one

	•	Lemmas vs. surface forms (e.g., "ride" vs "riding" for Actions)?
Examples: "riding", "walking", "staring", "fighting", …

	•	ASCII-only or allow diacritics?
ASCII-only

	3.	Synonymy & canonical choices

	•	Choose one canonical: "gunfight" vs. "shootout", "cowpoke" vs. "cowboy", "saloon" vs. "bar".
Gunfight
Cowpoke
Saloon

	•	Provide 5–10 canonical pairs per category if possible.

	- Protagonists
		- "cowboy" vs "cowpoke" → "cowpoke"
		- "lady" vs "rich woman" → "lady"
		- "gentelman" vs "well-dressed man" → "gentleman"
		- "prostitute" vs "sex worker" → "prostitute"
		- "townspeople" vs "people" vs "citizens" → "townspeople"
	- Place
		- "saloon" vs "bar" → "saloon"
		- "wooden house" vs "wooden structure" → "wooden house"
		- "empty field" vs "plains" → "plains"
		- "wooden train bridge" vs "rail trestle" → "rail trestle"
	- Actions
		- "staring" vs "gazing" → "staring"
		- "riding" vs "on horseback" → "riding"
		- "approaching" vs "walking to house" → "approaching"
		- "coming out" vs "exiting" → "exiting"
	- Objects
		- "cowpoke hat" vs "hat" → "cowpoke hat"
		- "fur hat" vs "hat" → "fur hat"
		- "confederate hat" vs "hat" → "confederate hat"
		- "magazine" vs "catalogue" → "catalogue"
		- "steam" vs "train with steam coming out" → "steam"

	•	Should the system deduplicate near-synonyms automatically and keep only the canonical term?

	Absolutely yes

	4.	Protagonists (who counts)

	•	Humans only, or also animals (you mentioned yes when integral): do we also include groups/crowds tokens like "posse", "townsfolk", "bandits"?
	→ Yes humans and animals

	•	Role vs. attire: do tokens like "sheriff", "outlaw", "bartender", "card dealer", "preacher", "soldier" belong here?
	→ Yes absolutely. Yehaw!

	•	Exclusions: forbid proper names, ethnic descriptors, age, or sensitive attributes?
	→ Forbidden
	→ When important (old man = important, boy = important, age of adults are not important)
	→ Yes, sensitive attribute if you mean "one-armed man" or "sick man" yes they should be described

	•	When ambiguous silhouettes/background extras: include "bystanders" or leave []?
	- Silhoutte if part of scene
	- If too ambiguous, leave `[]`

	5.	Place (granularity & composition)

	•	Scene vs. locale vs. sub-locale: is "interior","saloon" acceptable together? What about "interior","train","caboose"?
	→ "interior", "saloon" are both good
	→ "interior", "train", "caboose" is also good

	•	Outdoors typology: "desert", "mesa", "canyon", "plains", "forest", "riverside", "main street"—confirm allowed patterns.
	→ All these are great

	•	Built environments: "sheriff office", "rail depot", "homestead", "mineshaft", "gallows"—acceptable?
	→ All these are great

	•	If location is unclear but clearly indoor/outdoor, do we still emit "interior" or "exterior" or leave []?
	→ if unclear, just leave `[]`

	6.	Actions (scope & limits)

	•	Strictly visible, present-tense, 1–2 words (your rule) — confirm verbs vs. event nouns: "shooting" vs. "shootout".
	→ When possible, choose "shooting"
		
	•	Atomic vs. composite: allow both "walking","talking" together?
	→ Yes, they sometimes define the particularity of the situation when together

	•	Camera-driven actions (e.g., "embracing", "reloading", "holstering", "staring", "riding", "lassoing", "brawling", "pursuit") — confirm canonical set for 20–40 common actions.
	→ All these are good: "embracing", "reloading", "holstering", "staring", "riding", "lassoing", "brawling", "pursuit", "shooting", "sleeping", "smiling", "falling", "pouring", "pointing", "loading", "attaching", "climbing", "walking", "running", "jumping", …


	•	When multiple micro-actions occur, cap list length (e.g., max 4)?
	→ Choose the most important
	→ Put in order of importance
	→ No more than 4

	7.	Objects (salience thresholds)

	•	Salience rule: only objects central to the shot’s meaning or clearly legible above some size/visibility threshold?
	→ Yes

	•	Canonicalization: "revolver" vs. "gun"; "rifle", "shotgun", "winchester" — how specific?
	→ "revolver"
	→ "rifle"
	→ "winchester"
	→ "gun" is okay sometimes when not important what type (several types of guns, for example)

	•	Apparel & props: include "hat", "duster", "spurs", "badge", "lasso", "canteen", "saddle"?
	- "hat", "badge", "lasso", "canteen", "saddle" are all good but also be more specific when possible (e.g., "cowpoke hat", "confederate hat", "fur hat", etc.)

	•	Printed matter/signage: "wanted poster", "telegraph", "newspaper", "ledger" — allowed?
	→ Yes all good
	
	•	Natural objects vs. manmade: include "cactus", "rock", "tree", "river"?
	→ Yes all good

	•	Vehicles/animals as objects when not protagonists: "horse", "stagecoach", "train"?
	→ Yes, sometimes they are just objects

	•	Cap list length?
	→ No more than 4 items is a good rule

	8.	Ordering & cardinality

	•	Should arrays be sorted (e.g., alpha) or salience-ranked (most important first)?
	→ Salience-ranked (most important first)

	•	Any hard caps per array (e.g., Protagonists ≤ 3, Objects ≤ 8)?
	→ Protagonists ≤ 4
	→ Place ≤ 3
	→ Actions ≤ 3
	→ Objects ≤ 3

	If there are multiple soldiers, for example, we  say "soldiers" instead of listing each one individually.

	9.	Ambiguity & abstention policy

	•	Confirm: if ambiguous/irrelevant → return [] for that category
	→ Yes, absolutely return `[]` for category when ambiguous/irrelevant

	•	Must output all four keys
	
	•	Confidence threshold: do you want a hard abstain unless ≥ some internal confidence, or just the visible best guess?
	→ Not sure what you mean by internal confidence, but we want the best guess based on visible information. Maybe we dont undertsand this question well.

	10.	Language & film-specific constraints

	•	Always English?
	→ Yes, always English

	•	No film/character names, quotes, or dialogue tokens — confirm.
	→ Confirmed, no film/character names, quotes, or dialogue tokens ever. Dont ever mention Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, or any other actor/character names.

	•	Time-period leakage: forbid anachronistic tags even if present (e.g., "microphone") unless visibly on screen?
	→ Some westerns have cars. Ignore them.

	11.	Input/Output contract details

	•	Input unit: per-shot (spanning multiple frames) or per-frame? If per-shot, do we assume the most representative frame or aggregate across frames?
	→ Per-shot, aggregate across frames

	•	Output must always include all four keys exactly as in the schema ("Protagonists", "Place", "Actions", "Objects") with arrays of strings (possibly empty) — confirm.
	→ Confirmed. All four keys exactly as in the schema with arrays of strings (possibly empty).
	→ Empty arrays when nothing to report.

	•	Any additional top-level keys (e.g., "errors": []) are forbidden per schema, correct?
	→ Correct, no additional top-level keys

	12.	Hard constraints & refusals

	•	List any forbidden tokens (e.g., slurs, body descriptors).
	→ Forbidden tokens: any proper names, "indian", "redskin", "savage", "cripple", (n-word), "oriental", "foreigner", "half-breed", "mulatto", "gypsy", "hunchback", "dwarf", "midget"
	→ Allowed: "native" (specify ethnicity instead of slur or "foreigner" or "savage"), "blind", "amputee", "stranger", "migrant", "settler", "pioneer", "old man", "boy", "girl", "insane", "lunatic"

	•	Privacy/sensitivity constraints beyond names.
	→ No sensitive attributes beyond names except when important to the scene

	13.	Examples (gold annotations)

	•	Provide 5–10 gold examples (image descriptions optional) with the exact JSON output you expect for typical Western shots (saloon talk, high-noon duel, cavalry charge, card table con, train robbery, canyon ambush, prairie campfire, courtroom scene, etc.). These will become unit tests inside the system prompt.

	JSON Example 1: Breakheart-Pass(1975){tmdb-8043}_shot_0011.jpg
{
  "Protagonists": [],
  "Place": ["railway", "mountains"],
  "Actions": ["rolling"],
  "Objects": ["train","steam"]

  "Objects": []
}

  "Actions": ["exiting"],
  "Objects": []
}

{
  "Protagonists": ["soldier"],
  "Place": [],
  "Actions": ["staring"],
  "Objects": []
}

	14.	Failure handling

	•	If the model detects non-Western footage or animated/archival anomalies, do you want a generic abstain (all arrays []) or proceed denotatively anyway?
	→ Ignore all title-cards, animated, or non-western footage. Return all arrays `[]` in these cases.
